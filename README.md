# ERC20 Pickle Challenge

Simple ERC20 compliant token with a fixed supply and a burn mechanism.
Inspired by bowtiedpickle's twitter challenge.

I am also using this project to learn how to use git.

## Disclaimer

This is a project I'm building as practice, I cannot assure this code to be bug free or exploit proof.
